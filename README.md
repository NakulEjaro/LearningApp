## 💪🏼 Getting Started

This project is built on react-native CLI, so make sure you've [set up development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

```bash
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/Aashu-Dubey/React-Native-UI-Templates.git
cd ./React-Native-UI-Templates

# install dependencies
yarn install

# iOS only
npx pod-install ios
# or
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Run Android
npx react-native run-android

```

## 🌻 Motivation

This was initially started as my learning project and is inspired from the Flutter project [Best-Flutter-UI-Templates](https://github.com/mitesh77/Best-Flutter-UI-Templates).
